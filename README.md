##🌟 Hi there! I'm Rosario
I'm an incoming sophomore studying Computer Science, deeply curious about how machine learning and AI can drive real-world change. I thrive on blending theory and practice—especially when it helps communities build accessible, sustainable tech.

💡 What I’m Working On
🎯 Tuning sentiment analysis models for nuanced book reviews

🔧 Building geometric slicing workflows for efficient 3D printing

🤝 Designing mobile apps that foster engagement in student communities

🧠 Skills I Bring
Machine Learning: NLP, neural nets, model evaluation, interpretability

Development: Python, Flutter, React Native

Problem-Solving: Visual reasoning, algorithm design, feature engineering

Collaboration: Bilingual peer mentorship (English/Spanish), event leadership

🌍 My Goals
Democratize ML/AI education for underrepresented groups

Create intuitive, free tools that make tech more approachable

Build projects that improve everyday life—one thoughtful line of code at a time
